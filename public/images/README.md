# Images Folder

Please place your 5 images in this folder with the following names:

- `image1.jpg` (or .png, .webp, etc.)
- `image2.jpg`
- `image3.jpg`
- `image4.jpg`
- `image5.jpg`

**How to get your images:**

1. Open each ChatGPT image URL in your browser (while logged into ChatGPT)
2. Right-click the image and "Save Image As..."
3. Save them to this `public/images/` folder with the names above
4. The images will automatically appear in the scrolling section

**Note:** The ChatGPT API URLs require authentication and cannot be accessed directly from the website. You need to download the images and host them locally.
